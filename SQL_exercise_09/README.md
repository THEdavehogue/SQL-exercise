To set up this exercise, navigate to this directory from the command line. Run this command:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

This will install `pandas` and `sqlalchemy` if they are not already installed. Then, the `setup_db.py` script will create the database from the cran_logs_2015-01-01.csv file.


**NOTE: The installation of pandas and sqlalchemy depends on having Anaconda as your package manager, and the database engine used in this exercise is PostgreSQL**
